## Summary

Four circles placed at 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees around a central point using polar coordinates.

## What This Validates

- Polar position constraint converts (center, radius, angle) to (cx, cy)
- Angle convention and trigonometric calculations are correct
- Point anchors work as polar centers
