# Triangle with Direct Vertices

A triangle defined by three explicit vertex coordinates, bypassing the `kind` construction methods entirely. Useful for irregular triangles or when you already know the exact points.

## Elements

| Element | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `<Triangle>` | Primitive | Vertex-defined triangle |

## Props Exercised

- `vertices` — Array of three Point2D objects
- `rotation` — Rotation around centroid

## Default

<LiveCanvas code={`<Sprite viewBox="0 0 200 200">
  <Triangle
    id="custom"
    vertices={[
      { x: 30, y: 160 },
      { x: 170, y: 140 },
      { x: 80, y: 30 },
    ]}
    fill="#9b59b6"
    stroke="#6c3483"
    strokeWidth={1.5}
    rotation={12}
  />
</Sprite>`} />

## What This Validates

- `vertices` prop overrides `kind`-based construction
- Anchors are computed from the explicit vertices
- Bounding box is the axis-aligned bounds of all three points
- This is the escape hatch for any triangle geometry that doesn't fit a named kind
