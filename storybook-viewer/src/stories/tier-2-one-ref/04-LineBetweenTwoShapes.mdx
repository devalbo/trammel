# Line Between Two Shapes

A line whose start and end points are anchored to the centers of two rectangles using `start="#a.center"` and `end="#b.center"`.

## Elements

| Element | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `<Rect>` #a, #b | Primitive | Anchor shapes |
| `<Line>` #connector | Primitive | Connects the two rects |

## Default

<LiveCanvas code={Stories.defaultCode} />

## Resolver Trace

1. a resolves — anchors: center = (55, 50)
2. b resolves — anchors: center = (165, 50)
3. connector reads `#a.center` = (55, 50), `#b.center` = (165, 50)

## What This Validates

- Line `start`/`end` accept AnchorRef strings
- The `.center` anchor resolves to a Point2D (both x and y)
- Lines use start/end directly, not the virtual prop system
