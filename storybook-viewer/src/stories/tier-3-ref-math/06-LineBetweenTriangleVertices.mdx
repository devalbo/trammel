# 052 — Line Between Triangle Vertices

## Description

A line connecting the apex (v2) of one triangle to the base-left vertex (v0) of another triangle. Tests cross-shape vertex referencing.

## Elements

| Element | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `<Triangle>` #triA | Primitive | Source triangle |
| `<Triangle>` #triB | Primitive | Target triangle |
| `<Line>` #link | Primitive | Connects vertices across shapes |

## Syntax

```jsx
<Sprite viewBox="0 0 300 150">
  <Triangle
    id="triA"
    kind="equilateral"
    sideLength={60}
    x={20}
    y={30}
    fill="#4a90d9"
    stroke="#333"
  />

  <Triangle
    id="triB"
    kind="right"
    base={50}
    height={40}
    x={200}
    y={50}
    fill="#2ecc71"
    stroke="#333"
  />

  {/* Line from triA's apex to triB's right-angle vertex */}
  <Line
    id="link"
    start="#triA.v2"
    end="#triB.v0"
    stroke="#e74c3c"
    strokeWidth={2}
    style={{ strokeDasharray: "6 3" }}
  />
</Sprite>
```

## Default

<LiveCanvas code={Stories.defaultCode} />

## Resolver Trace

1. triA (equilateral, sideLength=60, x=20, y=30):
   - v2 (apex) = \{ x: 50, y: 30 \}
2. triB (right, base=50, height=40, x=200, y=50):
   - v0 (right angle) = \{ x: 200, y: 90 \}
3. link: start = #triA.v2 = (50, 30), end = #triB.v0 = (200, 90)

## What This Validates

- Vertex anchors from different triangle kinds are interoperable
- `#triA.v2` resolves to Point2D and works as Line `start`
- `#triB.v0` resolves to Point2D and works as Line `end`
- Different triangle kinds (equilateral, right) expose the same anchor interface
